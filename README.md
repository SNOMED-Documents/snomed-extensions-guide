# Extensions Practical Guide

The Extensions Practical Guide presents the purpose, process and principles of creating, distributing and managing SNOMED CT extensions. Extension producers should be familiar with this guidance to ensure the quality and integrity of the SNOMED CT editions that they publish.

This guide has been developed to assist National Release Centers and other extension producers to develop extensions based on recommended principles.
