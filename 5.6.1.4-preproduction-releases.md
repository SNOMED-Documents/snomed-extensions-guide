# 5.6.1.4 Preproduction Releases

Prior to the release of a SNOMED CT Edition it is strongly recommended that an alpha and/or beta version of the edition is created and released. This will give stakeholders an opportunity to test the edition, gain an understanding of any impact to their local systems, and identify potential errors that need correction. 

####  [ Alpha Release Package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/+Alpha+Release+Package "Glossary link:  Alpha Release Package")

A [SNOMED CT release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+package "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release package") made available only for initial review and testing by implementers and other stakeholders. 

### Notes

  * An _alpha release package_ must not be used in production clinical systems or in clinical settings. This includes [Affiliate Licensees](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Affiliate+Licensee "Glossary link: Affiliate Licensees") or any third parties, except those who have formally committed to test it.
  * An _alpha release_ is used to test the format and content of the [SNOMED CT release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release"). Feedback is elicited and changes are made prior to publication of the [beta release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/beta+release "Glossary link: beta release").
  * _Alpha releases_ were formerly known as a [technology preview](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/technology+preview "Glossary link: technology preview") releases.

####  [ Beta Release Package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/+Beta+Release+Package "Glossary link:  Beta Release Package")

A [SNOMED CT release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+package "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release package") made available for review and testing only. 

### Notes

  * Implementers and other stakeholders review and test the _beta release_.
  * The _beta release package_ is made available prior to the [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release"). It must not be used in production clinical systems or in clinical settings. This includes Affiliate Licensees or any third parties, except those who have formally committed to test it.
  * The _beta release_ status indicates it is expected to subsequently be confirmed as a [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release"). If there is significant issue in format or content, it may be withdrawn, or replaced with an updated  _beta release package_. Whether or not it becomes a [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release") is decided shortly before the due date for the next release. If a  _beta release_ is subsequently confirmed as a [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release"), all updates are fully version-tracked from the date of the  _beta release_. 
  * Beta releases were formerly known as [candidate baseline](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/candidate+baseline "Glossary link: candidate baseline") releases.

A beta release of an extension functions as a candidate baseline until the extension is considered mature and ready for publication. The duration of a preproduction release period can be as long as is required to ensure that the version that is finally published is as robust and error-free as possible. Extension producers should utilize the option of distributing preproduction releases to get feedback from relevant stakeholders on the content of the extension. This is particularly important because SNOMED CT's robust versioning mechanism means that any content that is officially published by an extension producer must be maintained indefinitely. Errors identified and corrected in an alpha or beta release can be fixed without requiring an ongoing history to be maintained. In contrast, errors identified in a published release must be traceable and made permanently available in the full history of the edition.
