# Concept Model Attributes

**Hierarchy**|  [ 410662002 | Concept model attribute|](http://snomed.info/id/410662002 "410662002 | Concept model attribute |")  
---|---  
**Purpose**|  These concepts provide the values for Relationship.typeId and represent the type of a defining relationship.  
**Examples**| 

  * [ 260686004 | Method|](http://snomed.info/id/260686004 "260686004 | Method |")
  * [ 260870009 | Priority|](http://snomed.info/id/260870009 "260870009 | Priority |")
  * [ 363704007 | Procedure site|](http://snomed.info/id/363704007 "363704007 | Procedure site |")

  
****Concept Addition Rules**  
**|  Additional attributes may be added in an extension, where required to support extensions to the SNOMED CT concept model.  
****Concept Addition** Uses Cases**| Extending the SNOMED CT concept model to allow sufficient definitions to be applied to concepts that are not sufficiently defined in the International Edition.  
**Additional Notes**|  Any attributes created in extensions need to be carefully managed and documented. Extension attributes may also need to be revised or inactivated to align with future changes to the concept model in the International Edition.
