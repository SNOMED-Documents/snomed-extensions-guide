# Considerations In Assessing Requests

## Considerations in Assessing Requests

As part of the assessment process to determine where the requested content belongs, following points are important to take into consideration:

1. The scope of various SNOMED CT Editions
2. Whether the request is permitted given the predefined principles around:
   1. Editorial rules and;
   2. Retaining the referential integrity of SNOMED CT

## Scope

When a SNOMED CT Member, or Affiliate organization which maintains an extension, identifies a requirement for new content they should evaluate the request by considering the following questions:

* Does the requested content fall within the defined scope of the International Edition?
* Is the requested content likely to be required by, or of value to, more than one Member territory?

If the answer to both these questions is "yes", the organization should submit a request to SNOMED International for the inclusion of the new content. When a request originates in an Affiliate organization, it should be submitted to a National Release Center who will then forward the request to SNOMED International. In general, this content should not be added to a National or local extension, as content that falls within the defined scope of the International Edition and is required by two or more Member territories. However, in cases where there is an urgent requirement, an extension producer may add the content to their own extension as an interim solution. Please refer to Interim Content Additions below.

Similarly, if the answer to one or both of these questions is "no", the content may be suitable for inclusion in a National Edition. In this case, the following questions should be considered:

* Does the requested content fall within the defined scope of a National Edition?
* Is the requested content likely to be required by, or of value to, more than one organization within the Member territory?

If the answer to both these questions is "yes", then the organization should submit a request to the National Release Center for the addition of the required content into the National Edition. If the answer to one or both of these questions is "no", it should be considered for inclusion in a local extension. In a situation where the request is considered to be out of the scope of SNOMED CT, it may be rejected. The table below provides additional detail on the various outcomes in these considerations.

## Referential Integrity and Editorial Principles

When determining whether or not a request for additions or changes should be accepted for inclusion in any SNOMED CT edition, it is important to ensure that the addition or modification does not break the referential integrity of SNOMED CT. It is also important to assess whether the definition of new concepts has undesirable effects on the existing content. Finally, it should be ensured that every addition of or modification to SNOMED CT concepts conform to the rules specified by the concept model. Section [Authoring](<../5.4 authoring/>) describes key principles which ensure that referential integrity is retained and that components and derivatives are created or modified in an extension in accordance with the editorial principles.

SNOMED International does not recommend that extension producers make changes which result in modifications to the International release as this can cause interoperability issues. Substantive errors, or improvements to content in the International release which are mitigated by the content in an extension, should, therefore, be forwarded to SNOMED International in a timely fashion to improve the quality of the International release.

In circumstances where the International release has been impacted by modifications in a national or local extension, a disclaimer notifying users of the differences between the extension release and the International release must accompany the national extension distribution files.
