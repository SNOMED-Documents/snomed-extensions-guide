# Tooling Requirements

It is important that extension producers understand that some aspects of authoring and managing an extension are complex and will benefit from appropriate tooling.

Editions should not be handcrafted or managed using documents, files or simple spreadsheets, as these are likely to lead to technical errors and inconsistencies. Extension content needs to be reviewed in relation to its dependencies on the International Edition (and any other dependencies) which makes manual management and validation of extension content an unsustainable practice. Tools are required to maintain SNOMED CT content appropriately and to initiate automatic checks which can prevent errors.

As part of authoring and preparing for a release, all extension producers need tools capable of managing RF2 release file structures and performing necessary validation checks. Managing of RF2 files includes a mechanism for creating components and reference sets. There may be additional functionality required but this will vary depending on the content of the extension. For example, some extension producers producing new clinical concepts will need to be able to classify their extension to validate the created content and create the inferred relationships (necessary normal view) based on the stated relationships in the extension. Extensions which are merely used to distribute a translated version of SNOMED CT, or locally defined reference sets that only reference international release content will not need this classifying functionality as these extensions will only include primitive, metadata concepts. Please see the section on  [Classifying an Edition for further information](<../5.6 distribution/5.6.1 preparing-for-distribution/5.6.1.1-classifying-an-edition.md>).

The table below summarizes the overall tooling considerations by category and services required. These are the tools required throughout the extension lifecycle including creation, management an distribution. Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but instead summarize some of the key tools and services required.
