# Assessing Change Impact

After identifying the components that have changed since the previous release, it is important to assess how these changes may affect the content of the extension. In particular, extension producers will need to ensure that the quality of the extension has not been compromised. For example, this may include checking that no relationship in the extension refers to an International Edition concept that has been inactivated, and checking for new concepts that may need to be added to reference sets in the extension.

The following table presents some examples of how changes in the International Edition may affect new versions of an extension. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, but instead provides examples of the types of maintenance tasks which are likely to be required when managing changes in an extension. Also note that extension consumers will need to assess the impact of changes in an extension edition on their implementations.
