# Preproduction Review

Prior to the publication of a SNOMED CT Edition or Extension, it is strongly recommended that extension producers provide stakeholders with early visibility of content changes. Early review helps implementers understand potential impacts on local systems, identify issues, and provide feedback before content is formally published and must be maintained indefinitely.<br>

Historically, this was achieved through alpha and beta releases. While this approach is still valid and may be used by some extension producers, SNOMED International (SI) and Member Services no longer routinely produce alpha or beta releases. Instead, alternative mechanisms are now used to support prepublication content review.

### Pre-production Content Review

SNOMED International no longer publishes formal alpha or beta releases for the International Edition or Member Services extensions. Instead, preproduction content review is supported through continuous visibility and communication mechanisms.

#### Daily Build Browser

Content changes for each monthly International Edition release can be reviewed via the Daily Build Browser, which provides early visibility of in-progress changes prior to publication.

#### Issue Reporting

Any potential issues identified during prepublication review should be reported to SNOMED International via:

* [SNOMED International Helpdesk](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* [Content Request Service (CRS)](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/T7gOK7qF5jKUT64ZHaBu/)

Early reporting allows issues to be addressed before content is officially published and becomes part of the permanent version history.

#### Monitoring for Local Extension Impact

\
To assess potential impacts on local extensions, extension producers and implementers are strongly encouraged to:

* [Monitor Early Visibility Release Notifications](https://conf.spaces.snomed.org/wiki/spaces/RMT/pages/131958586/2025+Early+Visibility+Release+Notifications)
*   [Review Briefing Notes](https://forums.snomed.org/c/briefing-notes)



These channels provide advance notice of significant changes, editorial policy updates, and upcoming content releases.

### Historical Approach: Alpha and Beta Releases&#x20;

Some extension producers may still choose to use alpha and/or beta releases as part of their development lifecycle.

#### Alpha Release Package&#x20;

A SNOMED CT release package made available only for initial review and testing.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes**



* Must not be used in production clinical systems or clinical settings.
* Access is limited to implementers or stakeholders who have formally committed to testing.
* Used to test format and content and to gather early feedback.
* Errors identified can be corrected without maintaining permanent version history.
* Formerly known as _technology preview releases._
{% endhint %}

#### Beta Release Package&#x20;

A SNOMED CT release package made available for broader review and testing prior to a production release.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes**

* Must not be used in production clinical systems or clinical settings.
* Represents a _candidate baseline_ expected to become a production release.
* May be withdrawn or replaced if significant issues are identified.
* If confirmed as a production release, all updates are fully version-tracked from the beta release date.
* Formerly known as _candidate baseline releases_.
{% endhint %}

A beta release of an extension may function as a candidate baseline until the extension is considered mature and ready for publication.
