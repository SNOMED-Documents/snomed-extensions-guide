# Implementation Guidance

Extension producers should ensure that the consumers of their extension understand how to use and implement the extension. It is therefore recommended that extension producers provide specific guidance on the:

* Purpose of the extension
* Scope and content of the extension&#x20;
* Module dependencies within the extension
* Usage of the extension

Additionally, it is important that consumers of the extension can trust the quality of the extension and understand how to validate its contents. It is therefore also recommended that guidance on validating the extension is provided.

Please note that this guide focuses on guidance for extension producers. Specific implementation guidance for extension consumers should be provided by the extension producer themselves, to supplement the general implementation guidance provided by SNOMED International (see [http://snomed.org/doc](http://snomed.org/doc)).
