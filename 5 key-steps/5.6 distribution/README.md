# Distribution

Distribution is the process of making the extension available to its consumers.&#x20;

It is the responsibility of the extension provider to ensure that everyone who accesses the SNOMED CT distribution has an appropriate license to do so. The extension producer must issue Affiliates with a license to use the extension. These licenses must include a requirement for the licensee to hold a SNOMED CT Affiliate License for the International Release. For more information about Members' responsibilities in relation to licensing, please see [The role of NRCs related to SNOMED CT licensing](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/irKbJsZG57nSWZA4GT0M/).

The following pages will examine the steps involved in preparing an extension for distribution and introduce different approaches to distribution.
