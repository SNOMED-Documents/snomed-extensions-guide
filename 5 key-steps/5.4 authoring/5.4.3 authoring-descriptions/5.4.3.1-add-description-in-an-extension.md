# Add Description in an Extension

## Purpose

The main reasons for adding descriptions in an extension are:

* To translate SNOMED CT into another language
* To add terms that are preferred or accepted within a local setting, for example
  * Common clinical terms that facilitate searching for concepts
  * Patient friendly terms
* To support the creation of new concepts in the extension, which each require at least two descriptions

## Principles

### Overview

As depicted in the image below, a description in an extension may refer to any concept in the same extension (Extension B), any concept in a module upon which the extension modules depend (Extension A), or any concept in the International Edition.

Note that the green and orange triangles pointing to the purple circle represent a situation in which a description is added to an extension that describes an international concept. These extension descriptions supplement the descriptions that are already part of the International Edition.

### Adding Descriptions for a New Concept

Descriptions in SNOMED CT are represented in a description file. At least two descriptions must be created for each new concept in an extension:

* A description of type [| Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001) (FSN)
  * Note that all extension producers should create an unambiguous FSN in US English for each new concept. Additional FSNs may also be created to support other languages and dialects.
* A description of type [| Synonym|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000013009) , in either English or an alternative language

The acceptability of new descriptions must be specified in a language reference set.

#### Adding Fully Specified Names

The following principles apply to adding FSNs in an extension.

* There may be more than one active description with a _typeId_ of [| Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001) (FSN).
  * However, only one FSN should be marked as preferred for use in a given language or dialect by a specific Language Reference Set.
* Every extension concept must have an unambiguous FSN in US English.
  * The US English FSN is the point of reference for the meaning of all concepts in the SNOMED CT International Edition.
  * The US English FSN is used to facilitate sharing and to resolve potential issues related to the interpretation of the meaning.
* Extensions producers are permitted to create a FSN in each of their native languages.
  * This means that a non-English FSN may be marked as the preferred FSN in a specific language reference set in the extension.
  * Consequently, a concept may have more than one FSN. However, only one may be preferred in a specific language reference set.
  * Where a concept has only one active description with a _typeId_ of [| Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001) across all language codes within a release, then that description can be assumed to be the FSN for all languages and dialects, and need not be explicitly included in every language reference set.

#### Adding Synonyms

* Unlike FSNs, _synonyms_ are not necessarily unique between concepts, as the same _term_ can be used to describe more than one concept.
* The preferred term is the synonym marked as preferred for use in the Language Reference Set for a given language or dialect.
  * There must be at least one description with a _typeId_ of [| Synonym|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000013009) and an _acceptabilityId_ value of [| Preferred|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000548007) for each concept associated with a description in a given language reference set.

### Adding Descriptions to an Existing Concept

When a description is created in an extension, as part of a translation or to provide a localized synonym for an existing concept, a new row should be added in the relevant language reference set to indicate whether the description is [| Preferred|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000548007) or [| Acceptable|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000549004) in the given language or dialect.
