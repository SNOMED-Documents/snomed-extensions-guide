# Remove Members from a Reference set

## Purpose

Reference set members may be inactivated when

* The reference set member is no longer relevant or valid in the reference set in which it is being used
* The reference set to which the reference set member belongs is inactivated

## Principles

Any inactivation of reference set members should be done in the module of the reference set producer.

## Process

The table below provides a summary of the process to follow when removing members from a reference set.
