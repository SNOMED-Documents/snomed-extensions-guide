# Inactivate Relationship in an Extension

## Purpose

There are a variety of reasons for inactivating a relationship in an extension, including:

* An extension concept has been inactivated, which requires all relationships that it participates in to be inactivated
* To correct errors in the definition of a concept
* To remove any redundant [| is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003) relationships, generated when classifying the extension edition
* To remove any 'temporary' relationships that were added to correct errors in the International Edition that have since been fixed in the International release

## Principles

### Inactivating Extension Relationships

Relationships in an extension can be inactivated if required. This is done by creating a new version of the extension relationship with a more recent _effectiveTime_ and the _active_ attribute set to '0' (for 'inactive').

### Inactivating Relationships from the International Release

Relationships which belong to the International Edition (or to a module on which the extension depends) should _not_ be inactivated in an extension. When relationships from the International Edition need to be excluded, this can be done by creating a simple reference set of either 'included' or 'excluded' relationships.

The only situations in which an extension producer may inactivate a relationship specified in the international edition (or a module on which the extension depends) are:

* Where an international [| is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003) relationship becomes redundant after classification is performed. For more information, refer to [Add Concept in an Extension](<../5.4.2 authoring-concepts/5.4.2.1-add-concept-in-an-extension.md>) and [Classifying an Edition](<../../5.6 distribution/5.6.1 preparing-for-distribution/5.6.1.1-classifying-an-edition.md>).
* Where there exists an erroneous relationship in the International Edition (or in a module on which the extension depends), that may cause incorrect inferences in the extension edition. If this occurs, the error may need to be temporarily corrected in the extension edition. In addition, SNOMED International must be notified of the error so that it can be permanently corrected in the international edition.

In these situations, the relationship from the International Edition (or module on which the extension depends) is inactivated by creating a new version of the relationship in the extension module with a more recent _effectiveTime_ and the _active_ attribute set of '0' (for 'inactive').

## Process

The table below provides a summary of the process to follow when inactivating a relationship in an extension.
