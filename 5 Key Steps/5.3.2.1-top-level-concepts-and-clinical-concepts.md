# 5.3.2.1 Top Level Concepts and Clinical Concepts

# Top Level Concepts

**Hierarchy**|  [ 138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept (SNOMED RT+CTV3)|](http://snomed.info/id/138875005 "138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept \(SNOMED RT+CTV3\) |")  
---|---  
**Purpose**|  The immediate subtype children of the root concept represent the most general types of SNOMED CT concepts.  
**Concept Addition Rules**|  It is strongly recommended that new top level concepts (i.e. direct subtype children of the root concept) are _not added_ in an extension.  
**Additional Notes**|   
  
  
# Top Level Clinical Hierarchies

**Hierarchies**|  All direct subtype children of [ 138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept (SNOMED RT+CTV3)|](http://snomed.info/id/138875005 "138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept \(SNOMED RT+CTV3\) |") except [ 900000000000441003 | SNOMED CT Model Component (metadata)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000441003 "900000000000441003 | SNOMED CT Model Component \(metadata\) |") .  
---|---  
**Purpose**|  These concepts represent a distinct type of clinical concept  
****Concept Addition Rules**  
**|  Subtype descendants of the top level clinical concepts may be added in an extension.  
**Additional Notes**|  Concepts added in these hierarchies should conform with:

  * Concept model rules applicable to the relevant concept domain
  * Quality standards applicable to all SNOMED CT clinical content.  

These concepts should be classified to generate a set of inferred relationships in necessary normal form, for inclusion in the extension distribution files.
