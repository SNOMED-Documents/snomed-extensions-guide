# 5.4.3.1 Add Description in an Extension

# Purpose

The main reasons for adding descriptions in an extension are: 

  * To translate SNOMED CT into another language
  * To add terms that are preferred or accepted within a local setting, for example 
    * Common clinical terms that facilitate searching for concepts
    * Patient friendly terms
  * To support the creation of new concepts in the extension, which each require at least two descriptions 

# Principles

## Overview

As depicted in [Figure 5.4.3.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEXTPG/5.4.3.1+Add+Description+in+an+Extension#Figure-descriptions-can-reference-concepts-in-other-extensions-or-editions "Descriptions can reference concepts in other modules on which the extension modules depend"), a description in an extension may refer to any concept in the same extension (Extension B), any concept in a module upon which the extension modules depend (Extension A), or any concept in the International Edition.

Note that the green and orange triangles pointing to the purple circle represent a situation in which a description is added to an extension that describes an international concept. These extension descriptions supplement the descriptions that are already part of the International Edition. 

## Adding Descriptions for a New Concept

Descriptions in SNOMED CT are represented in a description file. At least two descriptions must be created for each new concept in an extension: 

  * A description of type [ | Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001 "900000000000003001 | Fully specified name |") (FSN) 
    * Note that all extension producers should create an unambiguous FSN in US English for each new concept. Additional FSNs may also be created to support other languages and dialects. 
  * A description of type [ | Synonym|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000013009 "900000000000013009 | Synonym |") , in either English or an alternative language 

The acceptability of new descriptions must be specified in a language reference set.

### Adding Fully Specified Names

The following principles apply to adding FSNs in an extension.

  * There may be more than one active description with a  _typeId_ of [ | Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001 "900000000000003001 | Fully specified name |") (FSN). 
    * However, only one FSN should be marked as preferred for use in a given language or dialect by a specific Language Reference Set. 
  * Every extension concept must have an unambiguous FSN in US English.  

    * The US English FSN is the point of reference for the meaning of all concepts in the SNOMED CT International Edition. 
    * The US English FSN is used to facilitate sharing and to resolve potential issues related to the interpretation of the meaning. 
  * Extensions producers are permitted to create a FSN in each of their native languages. 
    * This means that a non-English FSN may be marked as the preferred FSN in a specific language reference set in the extension. 
    * Consequently, a concept may have more than one FSN. However, only one may be preferred in a specific language reference set. 
    * Where a concept has only one active description with a  _typeId_ of [ | Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001 "900000000000003001 | Fully specified name |") across all language codes within a release, then that description can be assumed to be the FSN for all languages and dialects, and need not be explicitly included in every language reference set. 

### Adding Synonyms

  * Unlike FSNs, _synonyms_ are not necessarily unique between concepts, as the same  _term_ can be used to describe more than one concept. 
  * The preferred term is the synonym marked as preferred for use in the Language Reference Set for a given language or dialect. 
    * There must be at least one description with a  _typeId_ of [ | Synonym|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000013009 "900000000000013009 | Synonym |") and an  _acceptabilityId_ value of [ | Preferred|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000548007 "900000000000548007 | Preferred |") for each concept associated with a description in a given language reference set. 

## Adding Descriptions to an Existing Concept

When a description is created in an extension, as part of a translation or to provide a localized synonym for an existing concept, a new row should be added in the relevant language reference set to indicate whether the description is [ | Preferred|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000548007 "900000000000548007 | Preferred |") or [ | Acceptable|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000549004 "900000000000549004 | Acceptable |") in the given language or dialect. 

# Process

The table below provides a summary of the process to follow when adding new descriptions to an extension. 

File Type| Process  
---|---  
**Description**  
  
|  A new row which represents the new description is added to the description file.  
The attributes of the new description are set as follows:

  * _id_ is set to a new descriptionId allocated within the extension namespace 
  * _effectiveTime_ is set to the date the extension will be published
  *  _active_ is set to 1 to indicate that the new description will be active at the time of publication 
  * _moduleId_ is set to the conceptId of a module that is managed by the extension producer 
  * _conceptId_ is set to the _id_ of the concept to which this description applies 
  * _languageCode_ is set to the two character code of the language in which this term was authored 
  * _typeId_ is set to indicate the type of the description 
    * Values include [ | Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001 "900000000000003001 | Fully specified name |") or [ | Synonym|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000013009 "900000000000013009 | Synonym |")
  * _term_ is set to the string of characters used to describe the given concept 
  * _caseSignificanceId_ is set to indicate the case significance of the term 

  
**Language Reference Set**|  A new row (or member) is added to each relevant language reference set.  
The attributes of the new language reference set member are set as follows:

  * _id_ is set to a unique automatically-generated UUID 
  * _effectiveTime_ is set to the date the extension will be published 
  * _active_ is set to 1 to indicate that the new member will be active at the tiem of publication 
  * _moduleId_ is set to the conceptId of a module that is managed by the extension producer 
  * _refsetId_ is set to the conceptId of the language reference set to which the member is added 
  * _referencedComponentId_ is set to the descriptionId of the new description 
  * _acceptability_ is set to indicate the acceptability of the new description in the relevant language or dialect 
    * Value is either [ | Preferred|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000548007 "900000000000548007 | Preferred |") or [ | Acceptable|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000549004 "900000000000549004 | Acceptable |")
    * Each concept may have only one preferred FSN and one preferred synonym in each language reference set
