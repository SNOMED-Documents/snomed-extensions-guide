# 5.4.3.2 Modify Description in an Extension

# Purpose

The main reasons for modifying a description in an extension are:

  * The description term contains an error that needs fixing
  * The case significance of the term needs to be changed
  * The acceptability of the description has changed - e.g. from acceptable to preferred, or from preferred to acceptable.  

# Principles

## Overview

Making changes to existing descriptions requires careful consideration, because the descriptions may have been used in clinical records to represent the meaning of the associated concept. Changes are, however, permitted, as long as only mutable attributes are modified. Immutable attribute values should not be modified.

The  _conceptId_ field, the  _languageCode_ field and the  _typeId_ field cannot change between different versions of the same description. If a change is required to one of these immutable attributes, then the existing description should be inactivated, and a new description with the required attribute values should will be added.

Extension producers should not modify descriptions, which are part of the International Edition. When issues with international descriptions arise, SNOMED International should be notified so the issue may be addressed in a subsequent release. 

## Changing Mutable Description Attributes

**Table 5.4.3.2-1** lists the various description attributes and their mutability. The following modifications to the mutable attributes are permitted

  * Changing the _active_ attribute to 0 (i.e. inactive). For more information, please refer to [Inactivating a Description in an Extension](5.4.3.3-Inactivate-Description-in-an-Extension_57815270.html).
  * Changing the term of the description. Please note that only limited changes may be made to the [term](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPRELFMT/term+\(field\)) field, as defined by editorial rules.
    * The International SNOMED CT Editorial Guide states when making a minor change to an FSN, a new description must be created and the old description must be inactivated. 
    * Permitted changes include modifications that do not alter the meaning, for example a spelling correction. For a list of permitted changes, please refer to the appropriate section of the [Editorial Guide](http://snomed.org/eg):
      * FSNs - refer to [Fully Specified Name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG/Fully+Specified+Name)
    * When in doubt, an extension producer should inactivate the description and add a new description with the required term.

## Changing the Acceptability of Descriptions

An extension producer may also need to change the acceptability of a description. For example, a synonym may change from being acceptable to preferred, or from being preferred to acceptable. This type of change does not require any modifications to the Description file. Instead, the associated member of the relevant language reference set must be modified. For more information, please refer to [5.4.6.2 Modify Members of a Reference Set](5.4.6.2-Modify-Members-of-a-Reference-Set_57815301.html).

# Process

The table below provides a summary of the process to follow when modifying descriptions in an extension.

File Type| Process  
---|---  
**Description**|  A new row which represents a new version of the description is created.  
The attributes of the new version of the description are set as follows:

  * _id_ is set to the descriptionId of the description being modified
  *  _effectiveTime_ is set to the date the extension will be published
  *  _active_ is set to 1 to indicate that the new version of thedescription will be active at the time of publication
  *  _moduleId_ is set to the conceptId of a module that is managed by the extension producer
  *  _conceptId_ is set the same as the original version of the description
  *  _languageCode_ is set the same as the original version of the description
  *  _typeId_ is set the same as the original version of the description
  *  _term_ is set to the (possibly updated) string of characters used to describe the given concept. Note: Only limited changes, in accordance with editorial rules, can be made
  *  _caseSignificanceId_ is set to indicate the (possibly updated) case significance of the term

  
**Language Reference Set**|  If no changes to the acceptability of the description are required, then no changes to the associated language reference set members are necessary.If changes to the acceptability of the description are required, a new version of the relevant language reference set member is added with the required _acceptabilityId_.
