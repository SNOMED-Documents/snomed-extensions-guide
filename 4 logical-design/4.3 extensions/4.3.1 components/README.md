# Components

Most extensions include additional concepts, descriptions and/or relationships. It is therefore important for extension producers to understand the logical design of these components, and any extension-specific rule related to these components.

The following subsections present logical design rules and considerations for components in an extension:

* Common Attributes
* Concepts
* Descriptions
* Relationships

For information about the process of authoring extension components, please refer to [Authoring](<../../../5 key-steps/5.4 authoring/>).
