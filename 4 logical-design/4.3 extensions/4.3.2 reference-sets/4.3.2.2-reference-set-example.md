# 4.3.2.2 Reference Set Example

All reference sets require a concept to be created that represents the meaning of the reference set, provides the identification of the reference set, and names the reference set. These reference set concepts are created in the [ | Reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000455006 "900000000000455006 | Reference set \(foundation metadata concept\) |") subhierarchy as subtypes of a reference set concept that represents the associated reference set pattern. For more information about creating a reference set concept in an extension, please refer to [5.4.5.1 Create New Reference Set in an Extension](5.4.5.1-Create-New-Reference-Set-in-an-Extension_57815295.html).

In this section, we discuss an example reference set concept ( [ | Route of administration reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/22321000087101 "22321000087101 | Route of administration reference set |") ) from the 20170430 Canadian extension, and explain how this concept and its associated descriptions, relationships and language preferences are represented.

# Reference Set Concept

Please note the following:

  * The id is a UUID that was generated for the corresponding refset member.
  * The moduleId indicates that these refset members belong to the [ | Canada Health Infoway Reference Set Module|](http://snomed.info/id/22091000087100 "22091000087100 | Canada Health Infoway Reference Set Module |") .
  * The refsetId column indicates that these rows are members of the [ | Canada English language reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/19491000087109 "19491000087109 | Canada English language reference set |") . Note, that if the relevant language reference set does not exist, this must be created using the same process.
  * The referencedComponentId column refers to the descriptions for which the acceptability is being specified.
  * The acceptabilityId column indicates the [ | Preferred|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000548007 "900000000000548007 | Preferred |") and [ | Acceptable|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000549004 "900000000000549004 | Acceptable |") descriptions in the given language dialect (in this case Canadian English).
