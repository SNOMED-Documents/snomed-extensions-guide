# Reference Set Example

## Reference Set Example

All reference sets require a concept to be created that represents the meaning of the reference set, provides the identification of the reference set, and names the reference set. These reference set concepts are created in the [| Reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000455006) subhierarchy as subtypes of a reference set concept that represents the associated reference set pattern. For more information about creating a reference set concept in an extension, please refer to [Create New Reference Set in an Extension](<../../../5 key-steps/5.4 authoring/5.4.5 authoring-reference-sets/5.4.5.1-create-new-reference-set-in-an-extension.md>).

In this section, we discuss an example reference set concept ( [| Route of administration reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/22321000087101) ) from the 20170430 Canadian extension, and explain how this concept and its associated descriptions, relationships and language preferences are represented.

## Reference Set Concept

In the image below, a row from the concept table is shown for the concept [| Route of administration reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/22321000087101) .
