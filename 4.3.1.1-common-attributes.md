# 4.3.1.1 Common Attributes

All components in an extension are represented using the same logical design as the International Edition. Concepts, descriptions and relationships all share four common attributes:

  * id
  * effectiveTime
  * active
  * moduleId

The following subsections explain how these attributes are used in an extension.

The first attribute of every extension component is **'id** '. The id uniquely identifies the component across all extensions globally. It is therefore important that extension identifiers are structured according to agreed rules. [Figure 4.3.1.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEXTPG/4.3.1.1+Common+Attributes#Figure-example-sctid-and-its-components "The four parts of an extension SCTID") shows the four parts of an extension SNOMED CT identifier (SCTID) - item identifier, namespace identifier, partition identifier and check digit.

[Table 4.3.1.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEXTPG/4.3.1.1+Common+Attributes#Table-components-of-the-sctid "Rules for each part of an extension SCTID") below explains the rules related to each of the four parts of a SNOMED CT identifier in an extension. 

Table 4.3.1.1-1: Rules for each part of an extension SCTID

**Order**| **Part  
**| **Rules**| **Example**  
---|---|---|---  
1| Item identifier| 

  * 1 to 8 digits in length
  * Allocated by the extension producer
  * Must be unique for the given namespace identifier and component type

| 528  
2| [namespace identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPEXTPG/Namespaces)| 

  * 7 digits in length
  * Allocated by SNOMED International to the extension producer
  * Not used in components created by SNOMED International

| 1000124  
3| [partition identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPGLOSS/Partition-identifier "Glossary link: Partition-identifier")| 

  * 2 digits in length
  * The following partition identifiers are used in an extension:
    * 10 - extension concepts
    * 11 - extension descriptions
    * 12 - extension relationships

| 10  
4| [check digit](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPGLOSS/check-digit "Glossary link: check-digit")| 

  * 1 digit in length
  * Computed from other digits in the SCTID using the [Verhoeff check](http://snomed.org/verhoeff) algorithm

# effectiveTime

The second attribute of every extension component is **'effectiveTime** '. This attribute specifies the date on which the specific version of the component was released, using the ISO 8601 YYYYMMDD format. When a component is added or modified in an extension, the effectiveTime of the component version will match the version date of the release.

# active

The third attribute of every extension component is '**active** '. This attribute specifies whether or not the specific version of the component is active at the given effectiveTime. The data type of this attribute is Boolean, with a value of "1" indicating that the component is active at the given effectiveTime and a value of "0" indicating that the component is inactive at the given effectiveTime. New components in an extension will use an active value of "1".

# moduleId

The fourth attribute in every extension component is '**moduleId** '. This attribute specifies the module in which the component is being maintained at the given effective time. The value of this attribute is the SCTID of a [module concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPEXTPG/Namespaces#Namespaces-ExtensionModules) that is created and maintained by the extension producer. Please refer to [4.2.1 Module Definition](4.2.1-Module-Definition_57815068.html) for more information on this topic.
